# Glance RSS 🇫🇷
Developed by **Zulak**

A minimalist, highly customizable RSS ticker for the Cinnamon Desktop (Linux Mint).

## 🚀 About
This is my **very first software project**! As a Linux novice, I wanted a simple way to keep an eye on news feeds without cluttering my workspace.
Special thanks to **Gemini** for being my AI thought partner on this journey.

## ✨ Features
- **Scrolling Ticker**: Shows "[Feed] | Article Title" in your taskbar.
- **Customizable**: Set your own colors, width, and rotation speed.
- **Multi-Instance**: Add as many feeds as you want.
- **Quick Access**: Click to see the 15 latest news and open them in your browser.

## 🛠 Installation
1. Move the `glance-rss@zulak` folder to `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/`
2. Right-click your panel -> Applets -> Download/Manage -> Enable **Glance RSS**.
